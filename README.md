# Simple Python Calculator

A basic command-line calculator written in Python that performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. [web:4][web:7]

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. [web:4][web:7]  
- Interactive command-line interface that asks the user for input. [web:1][web:7]  
- Validates operator choice and handles invalid inputs gracefully. [web:1][web:7]  
- Simple, beginner-friendly Python code structure. [web:5]

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system. [web:8]  
- A terminal or command prompt to run the script. [web:7]

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this project folder. [web:5]  
2. Open a terminal in the project directory. [web:5]  
3. Run the calculator script:

Make sure the file name in the command (`calculator.py`) matches your Python file name. [web:7]

## Usage Example

When you run the script, it will:

1. Ask you to choose an operation (for example: 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.). [web:4][web:7]  
2. Ask you to enter two numbers. [web:4][web:7]  
3. Display the result of the chosen operation. [web:4][web:7]

Educational Background and Concepts
What is a Calculator?
A calculator is a tool to perform arithmetic calculations — from simple to complex — empowering users to quickly solve mathematical problems without manually doing the operations themselves.

Arithmetic Operations
Addition (+): Sum of two numbers

Subtraction (-): Difference between two numbers

Multiplication (*): Product of two numbers

Division (/): Quotient of two numbers (division by zero undefined)

Python Programming Basics in this Project
Functions: Encapsulate arithmetic logic

Input Handling: Use input() for user inputs

Data Conversion: Convert inputs to float for decimal operations

Control Flow: Use while loops and if-elif-else for process control

Error Handling: Use try-except blocks to catch invalid inputs and exceptio

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more operations (power, modulus, etc.). [web:4]  
- Add input validation for non-numeric values. [web:7]  
- Create a menu loop to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. [web:7]
